    review: "I worked closely with Emily while rewriting a web application for our company. Our tasks were demanding and required attention to detail and technical acumen, all of which she demonstrated consistently. Since we were a small team, Emily wore many hats. She assisted with designing the UI, writing the code, and providing QA for the application. Emily was always open to tackling new and challenging problems, which greatly contributed to our ability to meet our goals and complete the project successfully. Emily is an exceptional developer who will be a valuable addition to any team. Her adaptability and propensity to excel in both remote and in-person environments affirm her status as a highly valuable asset. In addition to the technical expertise she brings to the table, Emily has a great sense of humor and is a lot of fun to be around. I hope to have another opportunity to work with her in the future."
